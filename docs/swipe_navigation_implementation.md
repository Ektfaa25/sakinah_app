# Swipe Navigation Implementation Summary

## Overview
The azkar detail screen has been successfully refactored to support swipe navigation, allowing users to navigate between azkar in a category by swiping left or right.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced State Management
- **Per-azkar counter tracking**: Added `_azkarCounts` and `_azkarCompleted` maps to maintain separate counter and completion states for each azkar
- **Page-based state**: Counter and completion status now update based on the current page index
- **Proper state sync**: When swiping to a new azkar, the UI updates to show the correct counter and completion status

### 2. PageView Integration
- **PageController**: Added `_pageController` to manage swipe navigation
- **Page change handling**: Implemented `_onPageChanged` to update current state when swiping
- **Conditional rendering**: The screen can handle both single azkar and multiple azkar lists

### 3. UI Improvements
- **Page indicator**: Added a visual indicator showing current position (e.g., "1 من 5")
- **Animated dots**: Visual dots that show current page position with smooth animations
- **Responsive design**: Page indicator only shows when there are multiple azkar

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Smooth transitions**: Azkar content animates smoothly when swiping
- **Counter persistence**: Each azkar maintains its own counter state
- **Visual feedback**: Proper animations and haptic feedback for interactions

## Code Structure

### Main Components
1. **PageView.builder**: Handles swipe navigation between azkar
2. **Page state management**: Maps to track counter and completion per azkar
3. **Page indicator**: Shows current position and progress dots
4. **Unified content building**: Single method builds content for any azkar

### Key Methods
- `_onPageChanged(int index)`: Updates state when user swipes
- `_incrementCounter(Azkar azkar)`: Increments counter for current azkar
- `_resetCounter()`: Resets counter for current azkar
- `_buildPageIndicator()`: Builds visual page indicator
- `_buildPageView()`: Builds the swipeable page view

## Navigation Flow
1. User taps category on home page
2. App loads all azkar for that category
3. User is taken directly to azkar detail screen with full azkar list
4. User can swipe left/right to navigate between azkar
5. Each azkar maintains its own counter and completion state

## Testing Status
- Code compiles successfully with only style warnings
- App builds and launches on iOS simulator
- Navigation from home page to azkar detail works correctly
- Swipe navigation implementation is complete and ready for testing

## Next Steps
- Test swipe navigation functionality on device
- Verify counter persistence across page changes
- Test page indicator behavior
- Ensure smooth animations and transitions
- Final user experience validation
