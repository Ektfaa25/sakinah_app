# Circular Button Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. **Circular Counter Button**
- Created a large circular button (120px diameter) that displays the azkar repetition count
- Shows current count (e.g., "1") and total required count (e.g., "3") 
- Interactive - taps on the button increment the counter
- Includes haptic feedback for better user experience

### 2. **Visual States**
- **Active State**: Shows current count / total count with category color
- **Completed State**: Turns green and shows checkmark icon with "تم" (Done) text
- **Progress Ring**: Circular progress indicator around the button shows completion percentage

### 3. **Enhanced UX**
- **Instruction Text**: Shows "اضغط للعد" (Tap to count) or "تم الانتهاء من الذكر" (Azkar completed)
- **Pulse Animation**: Button pulses when tapped for visual feedback
- **Color Transitions**: Smooth color change from category color to green when completed
- **Shadow Effects**: Attractive shadow around the circular button

### 4. **Integration**
- Replaced the old rectangular button with the new circular counter
- Added secondary outlined button for additional interaction (optional)
- Maintained all existing functionality (reset, copy, navigation)
- Preserved completion notifications and haptic feedback
